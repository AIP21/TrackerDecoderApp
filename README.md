# TrackerDecoderApp
An app version of my player tracker decoder.

This can ONLY BE USED with my Player Tracker mod for minecraft. The purpose of this app is to be able to view and analyze the data collected from the mod.
I also made this as a fun project to learn more about Java.

# Running the program
The program *should* do the following steps by itself, but its always better doing it yourself just in case. (My code tends to be unpredictable)
1. Put the .jar file in an empty folder
2. Create these folders "inputs", "outputs", and "worldImages"

Now you are good to go, just run the .jar file!
