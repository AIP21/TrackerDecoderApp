maxEntries: 2500 //The limit to the amount of data entries to compile into the final image or gif, useful when wanting a less-detailed, but quick output or when with low memory. Set to 0 to disable
dotShrinking: true //Whether or not to shrink logged dots if they are covering another logged dot. Disabled if individualPoints is false
maxAreaDensity: 5.0 //The maximum area density that can be used to grow the dot radius
pixelAlpha: true //Whether or not pixels should be slightly transparent so they don't overlap
drawType: 1 //The way to represent the positions. 0 = Pixel, 1 = Dot, 2 = Heatmap, 3 = Lines
lineThreshold: 200 //The maximum distance a player can move until its position change doesn't draw a line. This is to fix issues where massive lines are drawn across the map when players nether travel or die.
upscale: 1 //The scale multiplier. The higher the upscaling, the higher the final resolution. HIGHER VALUES DRASTICALLY INCREASE FILE SIZE AND PROCESSING TIME!
fancyLines: false //Whether or not to show arrows at data points when drawing using lines
hiddenLines: false //Whether or not to show lines that were hidden for being above the threshold
