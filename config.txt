size: 1 //Change the default position marker dot radius, 0 disables using dots to instead use a pixel to mark a position
convertChunkPositions: true //Convert logged chunk positions into block positions, this is done by multiplying the chunk position by 16
maxEntries: 0 //The limit to the amount of data entries to compile into the final image or gif, useful when wanting a less-detailed, but quick output or when with low memory. Set to 0 to disable
dotShrinking: true //Shrink logged dots if they are covering another logged dot. Disabled if individualPoints is false
maxAreaDensity: 5.0 //The maximum area density that can be used to grow the dot radius
pixelAlpha: true //Make pixels slightly transparent so they aren't hidden if they overlap
drawType: 2 //The way to represent the positions. 0 = Pixel, 1 = Dot, 2 = Lines
lineThreshold: 200 //The maximum distance a player can move until its position change doesn't draw a line. This is to fix issues where massive lines are drawn across the map when players nether travel or die.
upscale: 1 //The scale multiplier. The higher the up-scaling, the higher the final resolution. HIGHER VALUES DRASTICALLY INCREASE FILE SIZE AND PROCESSING TIME!
fancyLines: false //Show arrows at data points when drawing using lines
antialiasing: true //Use antialiasing when rendering. Used to smooth out the hard, pixelated edges
hiddenLines: false //Show lines that were hidden for being above the threshold
terminusPoints: true //Show dots at the start and end of lines
ageFade: true //Fade out older log markers, showing the age of the marker
ageFadeThreshold: 200 //How much to fade out older log markers. If 0, then it uses the max amount of log markers
